In this directory, we include the notebooks and scripts used to generate the QA figures that appear in the Merian survey paper.


Astrometric calibration tests: 
Crossmatching HSC stars and Merian stars and calculating the D(RA) and D(Dec) mean/median/rms offsets. We should have a function to select point sources with good photometry, isolated, and in limited colors (to get rid of quasars).
Repeat this test with the PS1 astrometric catalog (the LSST Pipeline should have the function to do that).

Photometric calibration tests:
Mean (or median) offset from the stellar locus & the scatter along the stellar locus.

Sky background subtraction test:
Mean (or median) sky object flux & its RMS (could be in a few different aperture choices).

Point source detection limit:
Only using the Merian catalog â€” calculating the S/N estimate for sources with 23rd mag and brighter. Try it for gaap 1p0 photometry.

S/N as a function of magnitude.
Infer the 5-sigma limit.

Single exposure tests:
Plot the 5-sigma limit (from sky objects?) as a function of t_eff for a variety of single exposures taken COSMOS in various conditions (and t_eff).
